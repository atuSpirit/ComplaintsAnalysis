# Complaint Assistant

## Problem
Every company receives complaints, however, if complaints escalate and are not 
detected timely, it might cause huge money loss. In 2011, a guy sued Bank of 
American asking for 1784 billion, trillion dollars, which is more than the 
GDP of the WHOLE planet.  This ridiculous lawsuit starts just from several 
frustrating phone calls he made to settle some incorrectly deposited checks. 
Except for these extreme case, complaint escalation might make 
you company lose your customer or ruin your reputation.  There is a study 
showing 58% customers will never use the company again after a negative 
experience, 49% will tell their friends not to use the business, and 34% will 
post a review online or share a poor experience on social media.  

## Solution
"Complaint Assistant" is web app leveraged by machine learning and NLP techniques
 that use historical customer complaint data to predict complaint escalation and 
suggest better response type.  Given a complaint narrative, "Complaint Assistant"
will give the probability of escalation given different response type.  A response
type with lowest escalation chance will be recommended.
